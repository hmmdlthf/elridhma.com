## Understanding Local SEO for Sri Lankan Businesses

### What is Local SEO?
Local SEO focuses on optimising your online presence to attract customers from specific geographic areas. When someone in Colombo searches for "web design near me" or "web designers Colombo," local SEO determines whether your business appears in those results.

### Why Local SEO Matters
For Sri Lanka businesses, local search dominance offers:
- **Higher conversion rates**: Local searchers are ready to buy
- **Reduced competition**: Compete locally rather than nationally
- **Mobile-first visibility**: Perfect for smartphone users
- **Trust building**: Local presence increases credibility
- **Cost-effective marketing**: Better ROI than broad advertising

### Local Search Ranking Factors
Google considers three main factors for local rankings:
1. **Relevance**: How well your business matches the search
2. **Distance**: Proximity to the searcher's location
3. **Prominence**: Overall popularity and authority of your business
