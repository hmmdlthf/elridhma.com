Sri Lanka's Data Protection Act (No. 9 of 2022) fundamentally changed how Sri Lankan businesses handle personal data online. All Sri Lankan businesses must comply with this law, making website compliance more crucial than ever.

At Elridhma, we ensure every website we build meets these legal requirements from day one. Here's your comprehensive guide to data protection compliance for Sri Lankan business websites.
