In the competitive Sri Lankan e-commerce landscape, website speed isn't just a technical considerationâ€”it's a business-critical factor that directly impacts your bottom line. Research shows that Sri Lankan consumers expect websites to load in under 3 seconds, and every additional second of delay can cost you significant revenue.

At Elridhma, we've helped Sri Lankan e-commerce businesses increase their conversion rates by up to 40% through strategic speed optimization. Here's why website speed matters and how to achieve lightning-fast performance.
