In the competitive Sri Lankan e-commerce landscape, website speed isn't just a technical consideration—it's a business-critical factor that directly impacts your bottom line. Research shows that Sri Lankan consumers expect websites to load in under 3 seconds, and every additional second of delay can cost you significant revenue.
